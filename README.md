# Project Documentation
It is a Remote Controlled car made as an application of what we have learnt in control course at the university. 

## Abstract:

> The project aims to design a car and do some control analysis on its system to apply what we have learnt in our unviersity control course. The main component of the car deisgn is the Arduino mircrocontroller that controls the movement of the car through digital signals received from the mobile phone via bluetooth module connected to the Arduino. In this open loop system of the car, we were interseted in studying the transfer function and analyse the its error that resulted from the studting its step response. Finally, all the project details was documented in the following sections.

## Introduction:

> The studied system is in the form of Arduino based, Bluetooth controlled RC car. It is controlled by a smart phone application that gives the moevment directions to a bluetooth module which translates them into digital signals inputted to the Arduino and processed by the uploaded Arduino-C code. After that, the Arduino sends its output signals to the car motor drivers to move them in the specified directions. In fact, this system is prone to err in some processes like the time of sending and receiving signals from and to the arduino and that what we studied in the anaylsis part.
